behavior is controlled by components attached to them. In addition to the standard components provided by Thunder Engine, developers can add their own components implementing game logic and gameplay features. These components allow triggering game events, responding to user actions, and modifying the properties of other components during gameplay.At the moment, Thunder Engine supports C++ and AngelScript for implementing custom components.Like many other assets, scripts are typically created directly in the engine editor. Within the Content Browser window, simply right-click and select Native Behaviour for C++ code or Angel Behaviour for AngelScript code from the context menu.A new script will be created in the Content Browser window in the folder you selected. You will also be prompted to choose a name for your new component.<img alt=\"media/new_script.png\" src=\"scripting/media/new_script.png\" target=\"_self\">It is good practice to give your component a meaningful name. The name you choose will be used throughout scenes and prefabs, and changing it afterward can be challenging.When you double-click on your new script, it will open in a text editor. By default, the Thunder Engine editor uses its built-in code editor.The initial content will look something like this:#include &lt;nativebehaviour.h&gt;\n#include &lt;log.h&gt; class NewNative_Behaviour : public NativeBehaviour { A_REGISTER(NewNative_Behaviour, NativeBehaviour, Components) public: NewNative_Behaviour() { } ~NewNative_Behaviour() { } // Use this to initialize behaviour void start() { } // Will be called each frame. Use this to write your game logic void update() { }\n};\nclass NewAngelBehaviour : Behaviour { // Use this to initialize behaviour void start() override { } // Will be called each frame. Use this to write your game logic void update() override { }\n};\nThe code written in your script will be executed by the engine's internal systems. Currently, we are interested in only two functions:\nThe start function is called every time an Actor containing our component is created in the scene. It is usually used for initializing internal variables of our component.\nThe update function is called every frame and is responsible for handling events within the game, where you can write gameplay logic.\nOf course, you can create your own functions to simplify working with the code.Now let's write something! Let's add the following code:// Use this to initialize behaviour\nvoid start() { aDebug() &lt;&lt; \"Hello world!\";\n}\n// Use this to initialize behaviour\nvoid start() override { debug(\"Hello world!\");\n}\nAfter saving your changes, the editor will detect them and start compiling your code. Note that compiling C++ code requires a compiler installed for your system:\nVisual Studio for Windows\nGCC or Clang for Linux\nXcode for MacOS\nNo additional actions are required for AngelScript code.After compiling the code, your component will appear in the drop-down menu of the Add Component button:<br><img alt=\"media/add_component.png\" src=\"scripting/media/add_component.png\" target=\"_self\">Let's add it to the selected Actor and start the simulation (Ctrl+G):<br><img alt=\"media/new_component.png\" src=\"scripting/media/new_component.png\" target=\"_self\">If everything was done correctly, you will see a message in the Console Output window:<br><img alt=\"media/hello_world.png\" src=\"scripting/media/hello_world.png\" target=\"_self\">","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Creating and Using Scripts","level":1,"id":"Creating_and_Using_Scripts_0"},{"heading":"Overview","level":2,"id":"Overview_0"},{"heading":"Creating Scripts","level":2,"id":"Creating_Scripts_0"},{"heading":"Script File Content","level":2,"id":"Script_File_Content_0"},{"heading":"C++:","level":3,"id":"C++_0"},{"heading":"AngelScript:","level":3,"id":"AngelScript_0"},{"heading":"Controlling Actors","level":2,"id":"Controlling_Actors_0"},{"heading":"C++:","level":3,"id":"C++_1"},{"heading":"AngelScript:","level":3,"id":"AngelScript_1"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"scripting/media/new_script.png","fullURL":"scripting/creating_scripts.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":["scripting/media/new_script.html","scripting/media/add_component.html","scripting/media/new_component.html","scripting/media/hello_world.html"],"createdTime":1770464517417,"modifiedTime":1770466925168,"sourceSize":3544,"sourcePath":"scripting/creating_scripts.md","exportPath":"scripting/creating_scripts.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":59,"backlinks":["scripting/index.html"],"type":"markdown"},"scripting/exporting_variables.html":{"title":"exporting_variables","icon":"","description":"When you create a script, the editor automatically generates it from a special template. The script will be inherited from a base class: NativeBehaviour for C++ and AngelBehaviour for AngelScript.You can add your own variables and declare them as properties accessible for editing from the Property widget in the engine editor.The code below declares the variable myVariable. When you add the component to any Actor in the Scene and select it, this property will be visible in the Properties editor as a field named \"My Variable\". The default value \"Some Text\" will become the value in the property editing window.#include &lt;nativebehaviour.h&gt;\n#include &lt;log.h&gt; class NewNative_Behaviour : public NativeBehaviour { A_REGISTER(NewNative_Behaviour, NativeBehaviour, Components) A_PROPERTIES( A_PROPERTY(string, myVariable, NewNative_Behaviour::myVariable, NewNative_Behaviour::setMyVariable) ) private: string m_myVariable = \"Some Text\"; public: // Use this to initialize behaviour void start() { aDebug() &lt;&lt; \"Current value of myVariable =\" &lt;&lt; m_myVariable.c_str(); } string myVariable() const { return m_myVariable; } void setMyVariable(string variable) { m_myVariable = variable; }\n};\nclass NewAngelBehaviour : Behaviour { string myVariable = \"Some Text\"; // Use this to initialize behaviour void start() override { debug(\"Current value of myVariable=\" + myVariable); }\n};\nEach Actor to which you add your component will have its own value for this property.

However, in your code, you still need to use the variable name you specified.In addition to basic property types such as string, integer, bool, and others, developers may need properties that reference other objects in the Scene (Transforms, Lights, Actors) or assets (Textures, Meshes, Materials). The code snippet below demonstrates how to achieve this:#include &lt;nativebehaviour.h&gt; class NewNative_Behaviour : public NativeBehaviour { A_REGISTER(NewNative_Behaviour, NativeBehaviour, Components) A_PROPERTIES( A_PROPERTYEX(Transform *, myTransform, NewNative_Behaviour::myTransform, NewNative_Behaviour::setMyTransform, \"editor=Component\") ) private: Transform *m_myTransform = nullptr; public: Transform *myTransform() const { return m_myTransform; } void setMyTransform(Transform *transform) { m_myTransform = transform; }\n};\nclass NewAngelBehaviour : Behaviour { Transform @myTransform = null; // Use this to initialize behaviour void start() override { // Implementation here }\n};\nNote that in C++ code, an extended property is added. In this property, you can specify additional metadata as a string. This is necessary for the editor to understand the type of property it is working with. In this example, we indicate that a special editor type Component should be created.Available editor types:\nColor\nComponent\nAsset\nAlignment\nAxes\nIn the Properties window, it will look like this:<br><img alt=\"media/my_transform.png\" src=\"scripting/media/my_transform.png\" target=\"_self\">Clicking the button in the property editor will bring up a special window that allows you to select the desired Object.<br><img alt=\"media/select_transform.png\" src=\"scripting/media/select_transform.png\" target=\"_self\">","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Variables and Property Editor","level":1,"id":"Variables_and_Property_Editor_0"},{"heading":"Overview","level":2,"id":"Overview_0"},{"heading":"Basic Property Example","level":2,"id":"Basic_Property_Example_0"},{"heading":"C++:","level":3,"id":"C++_0"},{"heading":"AngelScript:","level":3,"id":"AngelScript_0"},{"heading":"Object Reference Properties","level":2,"id":"Object_Reference_Properties_0"},{"heading":"C++:","level":3,"id":"C++_1"},{"heading":"AngelScript:","level":3,"id":"AngelScript_1"}],"links":["scripting/native_introspection.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"scripting/media/my_variable.png","fullURL":"scripting/exporting_variables.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":["scripting/media/my_variable.html","scripting/media/my_transform.html","scripting/media/select_transform.html"],"createdTime":1770463792886,"modifiedTime":1770464336754,"sourceSize":3776,"sourcePath":"scripting/exporting_variables.md","exportPath":"scripting/exporting_variables.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":60,"backlinks":["scripting/index.html"],"type":"markdown"},"scripting/index.html":{"title":"index","icon":"","description":"This section covers various aspects related to coding your game in Thunder Engine.Thunder Engine supports a number of programming languages to write your game logic.

Instantiating game objects from Prefabs instead of creating game objects from scratch during runtime has several advantages:\nCreate a complex object with just one line instead of describing all components and their properties in detail in code.\nModify the Prefab in the Editor and get updates without needing to update the code.\nEasily replace one Prefab with another without changing the code.\nTo instantiate a Prefab, you need to have a reference to it in your code. You can use a public variable to hold this reference. This variable will appear in the Properties editor, allowing you to assign the desired Prefab from the editor.C++:#include &lt;nativebehaviour.h&gt; class NewNative_Behaviour : public NativeBehaviour { A_REGISTER(NewNative_Behaviour, NativeBehaviour, Components) A_PROPERTIES( A_PROPERTYEX(Prefab *, myPrefab, NewNative_Behaviour::myPrefab, NewNative_Behaviour::setMyPrefab, \"editor=Asset\") ) private: Prefab *m_myPrefab = nullptr; public: void start() { Instantiate(m_myPrefab, Vector3(0, 0, 0), Quaternion()); } Prefab *myPrefab() const { return m_myPrefab; } void setMyPrefab(Prefab *prefab) { m_myPrefab = prefab; }\n};\nAngelScript:class NewAngelBehaviour : Behaviour { // Reference to the Prefab asset.

Unfortunately, not all programming languages provide it out of the box. Thunder Engine uses a Meta Object approach to define a class structure to be able to retrieve this information at runtime.To make properties visible in the Editor and in Scripts, engine developers need to define a special construction inside a class body.In the example below, the developer defines all required fields:#include &lt;nativebehaviour.h&gt; class MyComponent : public NativeBehaviour { A_REGISTER(MyComponent, NativeBehaviour, Components) A_PROPERTIES( A_PROPERTY(int, speed, MyComponent::speed, MyComponent::setSpeed) ) A_METHODS( A_METHOD(void, MyComponent::jump) ) public: int speed() const { return m_speed; } void setSpeed(int speed) { m_speed = speed; } void jump(int force) { // Do jump code here } private: int m_speed = 0;\n};\nThunder Engine's Meta-object system provides runtime type information like methods, properties, signals, and slots for inter-object communication.The meta-object system is based on two things:\nThe Object class provides a base class for objects that can take advantage of the meta-object system.\nThe A_REGISTER macro inside the private section of the class declaration is used to enable meta-object features, such as properties, signals, and slots.\nIn the provided example, the developer specified an introspection definition of the property speed:A_PROPERTIES ( A_PROPERTY(int, speed, MyComponent::speed, MyComponent::setSpeed)\n)\nDescription of parameters for A_PROPERTY:\nint - The return type of the property\nspeed - The name of the property that will be visible in the editor and in Scripts.\nMyComponent::speed - The getter function of the property.\nMyComponent::setSpeed - The setter function of the property. Note: If no public properties are provided in a native component, it is good practice to set A_NOPROPERTIES() in the class body. This will help avoid issues in introspection during inheritance.\nIn scripts, the developer can use not only properties but also call some functions for the component. In the example above, the developer has specified a jump method for introspection.A_METHODS( A_METHOD(void, MyComponent::jump)\n)\nDescription of parameters for A_METHOD:\nvoid - The return type of the method\nMyComponent::jump - The function which will be registered. Note: If no public methods are provided in the native component, it is good practice to set A_NOMETHODS() in the class body. This will help avoid issues in introspection in the case of inheritance.\nIn gameplay programming, if one object changes, we often want another object to be notified. Signals and slots are used for communication between objects. The signals and slots are made possible by the Thunder introspection system.#include &lt;nativebehaviour.h&gt; class MyComponent : public NativeBehaviour { A_REGISTER(MyComponent, NativeBehaviour, Components) A_METHODS( A_SLOT(MyComponent::slot), A_SIGNAL(MyComponent::signal) ) public: void slot(int value) { // Make reaction on signal here } void signal(int value);\n};\nTo connect objects, we need to call the connect function.Example:MyComponent component1;\nMyComponent component2; connect(&amp;component1, _SIGNAL(signal(int)), &amp;component2, _SLOT(slot(int)));\nIn this code, we connect the signal from the object component1 with a slot in object component2. This means when the signal of object component1 is emitted, the slot of object component2 will be called.Connection rules:\nThe signature of a signal must match the signature of the receiving slot.\nThe signal can be connected to another signal to relay the event.\nTo emit a signal, we need to call:component1.emitSignal(_SIGNAL(signal(int)), 5); // 5 is the value of the signal argument\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Native Introspection","level":1,"id":"Native_Introspection_0"},{"heading":"Overview","level":2,"id":"Overview_0"},{"heading":"Meta Object","level":2,"id":"Meta_Object_0"},{"heading":"Native Properties","level":2,"id":"Native_Properties_0"},{"heading":"Native Methods","level":2,"id":"Native_Methods_0"},{"heading":"Native Signals and Slots","level":2,"id":"Native_Signals_and_Slots_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"scripting/native_introspection.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1770463232900,"modifiedTime":1770463389280,"sourceSize":4233,"sourcePath":"scripting/native_introspection.md","exportPath":"scripting/native_introspection.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":63,"backlinks":["scripting/exporting_variables.html","scripting/index.html"],"type":"markdown"},"scripting/overview.html":{"title":"overview","icon":"","description":"Thunder Engine was designed to be modular. This means developers can enable or disable various modules. Developers can also create their own modules to meet their needs.In the Editor, your custom module will be created automatically when you create any Native Behaviour.

They can be united into hierarchies.<br><img alt=\"media/hierarhy.png\" src=\"scripting/media/hierarhy.png\" target=\"_self\">Components are the lifeblood of any game in Thunder Engine. Components contain information about how your game Actors look or how they interact with other Actors. This information is called Properties and it can be modified in the Editor or directly from the game code.Using the Native version of the API, developers are able to create any type of Components. However, when using the Scriptable API, only the Behaviour type of components is available.A variable that can be changed from the Editor or in-game.<br><img alt=\"media/properties.png\" src=\"scripting/media/properties.png\" target=\"_self\">The Position, Rotation, and Scale are properties of the Transform component.For a specific programming language, please refer to:\n<br><a data-href=\"doc_native_properties\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">doc_native_properties</a>\nWhen developing gameplay, sometimes it becomes necessary for one object to communicate something to another object. For example, a player has been killed and the \"Game Over\" window needs to be displayed. There are at least two ways to do this: call the window directly or just send a signal.

Custom modules enable developers to create specialized visual effects tailored to the specific needs of the game.This guide outlines the steps required to create, implement, and integrate custom modules into the VFX editor.To create a custom module in the VFX editor, XML code is used to describe the behavior, parameters, and operations of the module. Below is an example of creating a module that initializes particles and sets their parameters (lifetime, position, color, rotation, and size).&lt;module name=\"Spawn/SampleModule\" stage=\"update\"&gt; &lt;options name=\"parameterMode\"&gt; &lt;option value=\"Constant\"/&gt; &lt;option value=\"Random\"/&gt; &lt;/options&gt; &lt;params&gt; &lt;param name=\"lifetime\" type=\"float\" default=\"0\" mode=\"parameterMode\"/&gt; &lt;/params&gt; &lt;operations&gt; &lt;operation code=\"set\" result=\"p.lifetime\" arg0=\"lifetime\"/&gt; &lt;/operations&gt;\n&lt;/module&gt; module: This element specifies the name of the module, its type (e.g., \"Spawn/SampleModule\"), and the stage at which the module is applied (e.g., \"spawn\", \"update\", or \"render\").\noptions: Each module can contain different modes (e.g., \"parameterMode\") that determine how the module parameters are applied (e.g., constant or random value).\nparams: The parameters used to configure particle modifiers. Each parameter has a name, type, and mode (e.g., \"lifetime\").\noperations: The operations performed on the parameters to configure the state of particles. For example, the \"set\" operation sets the value of a particle's parameter (e.g., \"p.lifetime\").\nAn interface to work with this module will be automatically generated in the editor, allowing users to modify the module's parameters through the parameters panel.The VFX editor supports the following operations for manipulating particle parameters:This operation sets the value of a parameter. For example, you can set the lifetime or position of a particle.Example:&lt;operation code=\"set\" result=\"p.lifetime\" arg0=\"lifetime\"/&gt;\nThis operation performs addition on two values. It takes two input parameters and returns their sum.Example:&lt;operation code=\"add\" result=\"p.position\" arg0=\"p.position\" arg1=\"0, 1, 0\"/&gt;\nThis operation subtracts the second parameter from the first. It takes two input parameters and returns their difference.Example:&lt;operation code=\"sub\" result=\"p.position\" arg0=\"p.position\" arg1=\"vec3\"/&gt;\nThis operation multiplies two parameters. It takes two input parameters and returns their product.Example:&lt;operation code=\"mul\" result=\"p.size\" arg0=\"p.size\" arg1=\"e.deltaTime\"/&gt;\nThis operation divides the first parameter by the second. It takes two input parameters and returns their quotient.Example:&lt;operation code=\"div\" result=\"p.size\" arg0=\"p.size\" arg1=\"2\"/&gt;\nParameters used in custom modules can belong to different spaces. A space defines where and how the parameter values will be used.Parameters belonging to this space relate to the particle emitter itself. These parameters typically describe properties that affect all particles emitted by the emitter, such as emission speed or general effect settings.Example:&lt;operation code=\"multiply\" result=\"p.size\" arg0=\"p.size\" arg1=\"e.deltaTime\"/&gt;\nParameters in this space relate to individual particles. They control aspects such as size, color, position, and other properties that may change over time for each particle.Example:&lt;operation code=\"add\" result=\"p.position\" arg0=\"p.position\" arg1=\"0, 1, 0\"/&gt;\nParameters in this space relate to objects that can be rendered in the game. Typically, these parameters are only used in modules related to the \"render\" stage.Example:&lt;operation code=\"set\" result=\"r.size\" arg0=\"p.size.xy\"/&gt;\nParameters in this space can change relative to the particle or emitter's local position. They are used as temporary storage for intermediate calculations for subsequent operations.Example:&lt;operation code=\"mul\" result=\"vec3\" arg0=\"p.velocity\" arg1=\"e.deltaTime\"/&gt;\n&lt;operation code=\"add\" result=\"p.position\" arg0=\"p.position\" arg1=\"vec3\"/&gt;\nTo integrate a custom module into the editor, simply place the module in the Content Browser. Upon the next startup, the editor will automatically register it for use.Creating custom modules using XML allows you to extend the functionality of the VFX editor, creating unique visual effects for your game. By following the steps outlined, you can integrate new modules into the editor, configure their parameters, and optimize visual effects for specific tasks.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Creating Custom Modules","level":1,"id":"Creating_Custom_Modules_0"},{"heading":"Introduction","level":2,"id":"Introduction_0"},{"heading":"Creating a Custom Module Using XML","level":2,"id":"Creating_a_Custom_Module_Using_XML_0"},{"heading":"XML Example for Creating a Custom Module:","level":3,"id":"XML_Example_for_Creating_a_Custom_Module_0"},{"heading":"Breakdown of the XML Structure:","level":3,"id":"Breakdown_of_the_XML_Structure_0"},{"heading":"Available Operations","level":2,"id":"Available_Operations_0"},{"heading":"<strong>Set</strong>","level":3,"id":"**Set**_0"},{"heading":"<strong>Add</strong>","level":3,"id":"**Add**_0"},{"heading":"<strong>Subtract</strong>","level":3,"id":"**Subtract**_0"},{"heading":"<strong>Multiply</strong>","level":3,"id":"**Multiply**_0"},{"heading":"<strong>Divide</strong>","level":3,"id":"**Divide**_0"},{"heading":"Parameter Spaces","level":2,"id":"Parameter_Spaces_0"},{"heading":"<strong>Emitter (e.)</strong>","level":3,"id":"**Emitter_(e.)**_0"},{"heading":"<strong>Particle (p.)</strong>","level":3,"id":"**Particle_(p.)**_0"},{"heading":"<strong>Renderable (r.)</strong>","level":3,"id":"**Renderable_(r.)**_0"},{"heading":"<strong>Local (no prefix)</strong>","level":3,"id":"**Local_(no_prefix)**_0"},{"heading":"Integrating a Custom Module into the Editor","level":2,"id":"Integrating_a_Custom_Module_into_the_Editor_0"},{"heading":"Conclusion","level":2,"id":"Conclusion_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"vfx/custom_modules.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1770462638106,"modifiedTime":1770463390290,"sourceSize":5214,"sourcePath":"vfx/custom_modules.md","exportPath":"vfx/custom_modules.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":72,"backlinks":["vfx/index.html"],"type":"markdown"},"vfx/editor.html":{"title":"editor","icon":"","description":"The VFX editor is a tool designed for creating and editing visual effects (VFX) in the game engine. Using this editor, you can create particle effects, lighting, shadows, animations, and other graphical elements that enhance the visual experience of the game.This documentation is intended for users who want to learn how to use the VFX editor to create, configure, and optimize visual effects in their games.<img alt=\"media/editor.png\" src=\"vfx/media/editor.png\" target=\"_self\">The editor consists of several key areas:\nWorkspace: The area where VFX are visualized and edited, allowing you to configure and preview the effect in real time.\nParameter Editor: A panel located next to the workspace, where you can adjust the parameters of each particle modifier. Here, you can configure properties such as particle emission, trajectory, size, speed, and lifetime.\nPreview Window: The area where you can preview the effect in real time. The Preview Window updates as you change the parameters, allowing you to immediately see the results.\nIn the editor, effects are represented as a cascade of particle modifiers, which allow you to fine-tune every aspect of the effect.\nGo to the Content Browser.\nRight-click and select Visual Effect from the context menu.<br>\n<img alt=\"media/context_menu.png\" src=\"vfx/media/context_menu.png\" target=\"_self\">\nConfirm the creation. The new effect will appear in the Content Browser and will be available for further editing.<br>\n<img alt=\"media/new_effect.png\" src=\"vfx/media/new_effect.png\" target=\"_self\">\nAn effect consists of a series of modifiers that control different aspects of particle behavior. The cascade of modifiers allows you to configure:\nParticle Emission: Set the quantity and frequency of particle generation.\nMotion Trajectory: Define the direction and speed of the particles' movement.\nParticle Lifetime: Specify how long each particle lasts.\nParticle Size and Textures: Configure the appearance, including textures, transparency and other visual properties.\nEach modifier can be adjusted using settings available in the Parameter Editor.These modifiers can be divided into three types:\nSpawn - Modifier applied when a new particle is created:\nThese modifiers define the initial properties of a particle, such as its position, velocity, and other starting attributes when the particle is spawned.\nUpdate - Modifier applied to update the particle state every frame:\nThese modifiers are responsible for changing the state of the particle over time, affecting its movement, size, color, and other dynamic properties during its lifetime.\nRender - Modifier responsible for rendering the particle:\nThese modifiers control how the particle is drawn or rendered, including its appearance, texture, and any other visual characteristics that are applied during its display.\nEach modifier can be adjusted using the settings available in the Parameter Editor.Modifiers in the cascade control various aspects of particle behavior and their interaction with the environment. Properly configuring the modifiers is essential for achieving the desired visual effect. Adding a Modifier\nTo add a new modifier, click on the Add Modificator button in Properties and select one of the available modifier types.<br>\n<img alt=\"media/add_modificator.png\" src=\"vfx/media/add_modificator.png\" target=\"_self\">\nSome of the available modifiers: Add Velocity – to modify the particle speed.\nRotation Rate – to control the particle rotation angle.\nColor Scale – to smoothly change the color of the particles from birth to death.\nSize Scale – to modify the size of the particles over time. Configuring Modifier Parameters\nAfter adding a modifier, you can adjust its parameters in the Parameter Editor. Depending on the modifier type, different settings will be available. For example: For the Velocity modifier, you can set the speed and direction.\nFor Color Scale, you can select the initial and final particle colors, as well as the duration of the color change. Previewing Changes\nAfter adding and configuring the modifiers, you can immediately see the result in the Preview window.
